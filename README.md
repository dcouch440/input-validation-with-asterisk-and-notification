## `About`

This is a small simple but scalable application dedicated to implementing yup validation with callback objects to pass through information to the catch block.
    This concept will provide
    - Asterisk is hidden if no error occurred during submission
    - Asterisk notification on titles of inputs if there are errors.
    - If a form is paginated state can be set to move the user back to page where the error occurred.
    - Users get a plain english explanation of where the error occurred
